In the last lesson, we talked about permutations in the context of a coverband creating a setlist. We wanted to know how many ways we could order 3 songs in their setlist. There were 3 possible ways of choosing a first song, 2 possible ways of choosing a second song, and only 1 way of choosing a third and final song, for $3 * 2 *1 = 6$ different ways in which the three different songs could be played. This number, 6, is equal to the factorial of 3, $3!$, the number of permutations of 3 distinct objects. \n\nHere, $3! = (3 * 2 * 1) = 6$. Notice that this is the same as writing $3 * 2! = 3 * (2 * 1)$ and $3 * 2 * 1! = 3 * 2 * (1)$. (By definition, the factorial of 1, $1!$, is equal to 1. The factorial of 0, $0!$ is also defined to be equal to 1.)\n\nWe can generalize this to the case of computing the factorial of an integer n, $n!$. The factorial of n, $n!$, can be written as $n * (n-1)!$, which itself can be written as $n * (n-1) * (n-2)!$. That is, we can define the factorial of n in terms of the product of n by the factorial of (n-1), and so on and so forth, as seen in the equation below: \n\n$$ n! = n * (n-1)! = n * (n-1) * (n-2)! = ... = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * \\ldots * 1! = n* (n-1) * (n-2) * \\ldots * 2 * 1 $$ \n\nEarlier in this lab, we defined a Python function, `factorial(n)`, to compute the factorial of an integer n. In that case, we used a `while` loop with a stopping criterion to obtain a result. \n\nHowever, there is another way we could have defined this function, using the __recursive__ nature of the factorial function.\n\n### Recursion \nWhen we define a function in terms of itself, in this case, the factorial of n in terms of the factorial of (n-1), we are using **recursion**.  Recursive functions are functions that can call themselves in order to loop until a condition is met. \n\nWe can use recursion to define a function that will return the factorial of an integer n as follows: \n\n``` python\ndef factorial_recursion(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial_recursion(n-1) \n```\n\nLet's go over what happens with this function for the case n = 3: \n\n* To start, since n is not equal to 1, we skip the `if` statement and continue to the `else` statement, where we obtain that `factorial_recursion(3) = 3 * factorial_recursion(2)`.\n\n* To calculate `factorial_recursion(2)`, since the argument passed to the function is not equal to 1, we once again skip the `if` statement and continue to the `else` statement, where we obtain that `factorial_recursion(2) = 2 * factorial_recursion(1)`. \n    * At this point, `factorial_recursion(3) = 3 * (2 * factorial_recursion(1))`\n\n* To calculate `factorial_recursion(1)`, since the argument passed to the function _is_ equal to 1, we return 1. \n    * At this point, `factorial_recursion(3) = 3 * 2 * 1`, and our code returns the answer we expect, `6`. \n\nTry it out in the code cell below!"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Uncomment the lines of code below:\n\ndef factorial_recursion(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n-1) \n\nfactorial_recursion(3)","execution_count":32,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":32,"data":{"text/plain":"6"},"metadata":{}}]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As a last step, check that the result you obtain with the `factorial_recursion` function for n = 3 is the same as the result you obtain with the `factorial` function defined earlier in this lab:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Your code here \nfactorial_recursion(3)==factorial(3)","execution_count":35,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":35,"data":{"text/plain":"True"},"metadata":{}}]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Good job! \n\n## Summary"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this lab, you got quite some practice with permutations and factorials, and were even able to use it to calculate probability.
